# challenge-1-horiseon

In this challenge I was tasked with refractoring existing HTML and CSS code in order to improve accessibility.

To achieve this, I updated the source HTML code using semantic elements. This will help future developers be able to better navigate and further refactor the code as these elements are more descriptive and logical compared to only using divs.

I structured the CSS as intended, to be top down and logical. I began with my global styles across the page and then moved sequentially down to the header, body, and footer styles. I was able to eliminate redundancy in the CSS by improving the specificity of the selectors that I used in the HTML.

I made sure that all links were operational and that no functionality was lost as I refactored the code.

I updated each image and icon to include an alt descriptions so that this page would be accessible to folks who use screen readers.

Lastly, I updated the title to Horiseon so that the tab, when seen in the browser, would be more descriptive.
